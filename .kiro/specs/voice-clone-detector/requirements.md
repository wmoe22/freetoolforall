# Voice Clone Detector Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Voice Clone Detector is a security tool that analyzes audio files to detect artificially generated or cloned voices using AI signature detection. This tool helps users verify the authenticity of audio content by identifying potential voice synthesis artifacts and providing a confidence score indicating the likelihood that the audio contains cloned or synthetic speech.

## Glossary

- **Voice_Clone_Detector**: The system component that analyzes audio files for artificial voice generation
- **Audio_File**: Digital audio content in supported formats (mp3, wav, m4a, ogg, flac)
- **Confidence_Score**: A numerical value from 0-100 indicating the probability that audio contains synthetic voice content
- **AI_Signature**: Digital artifacts and patterns characteristic of AI-generated voice content
- **Analysis_Engine**: The backend service that processes audio files and generates detection results
- **User_Interface**: The frontend component that allows file upload and displays results

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to upload audio files to check for voice cloning, so that I can verify the authenticity of audio content before using it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User selects an audio file, THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL validate the file format and size
2. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL accept audio files in mp3, wav, m4a, ogg, and flac formats
3. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL reject files larger than 32MB
4. WHEN an invalid file is selected, THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL display an error message explaining the file requirements
5. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL display the selected file name and size before analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security professional, I want to analyze audio files for AI-generated content, so that I can identify potential deepfake audio in investigations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User initiates analysis, THE Analysis_Engine SHALL process the audio file for AI signatures
2. THE Analysis_Engine SHALL complete analysis within 60 seconds for files under 10MB
3. WHILE analysis is in progress, THE User_Interface SHALL display a loading indicator with progress information
4. THE Analysis_Engine SHALL generate a Confidence_Score between 0 and 100
5. WHEN analysis fails, THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL provide a clear error message and allow retry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a journalist, I want to see a clear confidence score for voice authenticity, so that I can make informed decisions about using audio sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes, THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL display the Confidence_Score prominently
2. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL show scores 0-30 as "Likely Authentic" with green styling
3. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL show scores 31-70 as "Uncertain" with yellow styling
4. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL show scores 71-100 as "Likely Synthetic" with red styling
5. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL include a timestamp of when the analysis was performed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand what the detection results mean, so that I can interpret the confidence scores correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL display explanatory text for each confidence level
2. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL provide information about detection limitations
3. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL include tips for identifying voice cloning manually
4. WHEN displaying results, THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL show the audio file duration and sample rate
5. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL allow users to clear results and analyze a new file

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the voice clone detector to integrate seamlessly with existing security tools, so that users have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL follow the same UI patterns as existing security tools
2. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL use zinc-800 background with zinc-700 borders for consistency
3. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL be accessible via the security hub with tool ID "voice-clone-detector"
4. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking the application
5. THE Voice_Clone_Detector SHALL provide appropriate loading states and user feedback
